*Health Insurance Portability and Accountibility Act*

## <mark class="hltr-pink">
Focus on Health Information</mark>
• **Scope**: HIPAA specifically targets the healthcare industry, focusing on protecting individuals’ medical records and other personal health information (PHI).

• **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Unlike other regulations that may cover general personal data, HIPAA strictly defines and safeguards PHI, which includes any information related to a person’s health status, healthcare provision, or payment for healthcare that can be linked to an individual.

## <mark class="hltr-pink">Privacy and Security Rules</mark>
• **Privacy Rule**: Establishes national standards for the protection of health information, detailing how PHI can be used and disclosed by covered entities (health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers).

• **Security Rule**: Sets standards for the security of electronic PHI (ePHI), including requirements for physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI.

##  <mark class="hltr-pink">Individual Rights</mark>
• **Access to Information**: HIPAA gives individuals the right to access their own health records and request corrections if they find inaccuracies.

• **Control Over Information**: Individuals have the right to know who is accessing their health information and to request limitations on certain uses and disclosures.

## <mark class="hltr-pink">Breach Notification</mark>
• **Mandatory Reporting**: HIPAA requires covered entities to notify individuals, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and sometimes the media, in the event of a breach involving unsecured PHI.

• **Timely Notification**: Breach notifications must be provided without unreasonable delay and within 60 days of discovery.

## <mark class="hltr-pink">Enforcement and Penalties</mark>
• **Enforcement by HHS**: The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within HHS enforces HIPAA compliance through audits and investigations.

• **Penalties for Non-Compliance**: HIPAA imposes substantial fines for non-compliance, which can range from $100 to $50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum of $1.5 million.
  
## <mark class="hltr-pink">Business Associates</mark>
• **Third-Party Requirements**: HIPAA extends its requirements to business associates—entities that handle PHI on behalf of covered entities—through Business Associate Agreements (BAAs).

• **Liability for Associates**: Business associates are directly liable for compliance with certain provisions of the HIPAA regulations.

**Preemption of State Laws**
• **Stricter Standards**: HIPAA preempts state laws that are less stringent, but allows for state laws that provide greater privacy protections.

• **Uniform Standards**: By setting national standards, HIPAA aims to create uniformity in how health information is protected across the United States.
