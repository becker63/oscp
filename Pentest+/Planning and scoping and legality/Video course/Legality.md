As noted in [[Rules of Engagement#<mark class="hltr-blue">Legal limits</mark>|Legal Limits]] there are law implications to be considered when doing penetration tests, lets look at the specific American laws to pay attention to. (I heavily used chatgpt for this ;]). And some other things.


# Export Restrictions 
In some countrys cyber tools like strong encyption may not be allowed to be used.

## <mark class="hltr-blue">Wassenaar Arrangement</mark>

### Purpose
Penetration testing often involves the use of specialized software, tools, and technologies to assess the security of computer systems, networks, and applications. Some of these tools may have dual-use applications, meaning they can be used for legitimate cybersecurity purposes as well as potentially malicious activities. Wassenaar controls this in the following ways.
### Key Provisions
* ***Export Controls**: The Wassenaar Arrangement includes guidelines for member states to regulate the export of certain cybersecurity technologies and tools, including penetration testing software. If a penetration testing tool is classified as having dual-use capabilities, it may be subject to export controls, depending on the specific regulations of member states.
- **Licensing Requirements**: Member states may require licenses for the export of certain cybersecurity technologies and tools, including those used in penetration testing. Organizations or individuals conducting penetration tests across international borders may need to obtain appropriate licenses or comply with export control regulations to ensure compliance with Wassenaar guidelines.
- **Compliance Considerations**: Organizations that engage in penetration testing, especially those operating in multiple countries, need to consider compliance with Wassenaar-related export controls. This involves understanding the classification of cybersecurity tools, obtaining necessary licenses for export or transfer, and adhering to relevant regulations to avoid potential legal implications.
- **International Collaboration**: The Wassenaar Arrangement promotes transparency and collaboration among member states regarding export controls on cybersecurity technologies. This collaboration can facilitate discussions on the classification of penetration testing tools, the development of consistent export control policies, and information sharing on emerging cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities.



# Cybercrime Laws 

To summarize, if you do something out of scope or hack something your not supposed to, you will be heavily fined or be struck with heavy federal penalties dependent on the severity.

## <mark class="hltr-pink">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)</mark>
### Purpose
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) is a United States federal law enacted to address various forms of computer-related crimes and fraud.

### Key Provisions
1. **Unauthorized Access**: The CFAA prohibits accessing a computer or computer system without authorization or exceeding authorized access. This provision aims to deter hacking and unauthorized entry into computer systems.
2. **Damaging Computer Systems**: It prohibits intentionally damaging or impairing the integrity or availability of data, programs, systems, or information on a computer.
3. **Trafficking in Passwords**: The CFAA prohibits trafficking in passwords or similar information that can be used to access computer systems without authorization.
4. **Penalties**: The act specifies penalties for violations, including fines and imprisonment, which vary depending on the severity of the offense and the value of the information accessed or damaged.
5. **Civil Remedies**: It allows for civil actions by individuals or entities affected by CFAA violations, including seeking damages and injunctive relief.

## <mark class="hltr-yellow">Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA)</mark>

### Purpose
The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) is a United States federal law enacted to encourage voluntary sharing of cybersecurity threat information between private entities and the government.

### Key Provisions
1. **Information Sharing**: CISA facilitates the sharing of cybersecurity threat information between private sector entities, such as companies and organizations, and federal government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ).
2. **Liability Protections**: It provides liability protections to entities sharing cybersecurity threat information in good faith, aiming to incentivize participation in information sharing efforts.
3. **Privacy Protections**: CISA includes provisions to safeguard privacy by requiring the removal of personally identifiable information (PII) not directly related to cybersecurity threats before sharing information with the government.
4. **Federal Coordination**: The law establishes mechanisms for federal agencies to coordinate and disseminate cybersecurity threat information to relevant stakeholders.
5. **Cybersecurity Threat Definitions**: CISA defines key terms related to cybersecurity threats, helping to standardize terminology and improve communication between entities sharing information.
