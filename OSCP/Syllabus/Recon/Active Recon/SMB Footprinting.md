# Nmap

[[Nmap]] can provide us information about the service as it can with all the others, but unlike the others some of the scan it can run can take a long time. And default  scans wont provide us with as much information as we want, so HTB recommends  we look at other places first.

This is all we are going to get from a nmap defualt scan 

```shell
becker63@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p139,445

```

Take a look at the smb scripts but we can get more information by interacting manually with the service.

# rpcclient
```shell
becker63@htb[/htb]$ rpcclient -U "" 10.129.14.128

Enter WORKGROUP\'s password:
rpcclient $> 
```
rpcclient provides the following functions from its [man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html)

| **Query**                 | **Description**                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `srvinfo`                 | Server information.                                                |
| `enumdomains`             | Enumerate all domains that are deployed in the network.            |
| `querydominfo`            | Provides domain, server, and user information of deployed domains. |
| `netshareenumall`         | Enumerates all available shares.                                   |
| `netsharegetinfo <share>` | Provides information about a specific share.                       |
| `enumdomusers`            | Enumerates all domain users.                                       |
| `queryuser <RID>`         | Provides information about a specific user.                        |
We can use `queryuser` and `enumdomusers` to get lots of information about users on the system.

```shell
rpcclient $> enumdomusers

user:[mrb3n] rid:[0x3e8]
user:[cry0l1t3] rid:[0x3e9]


rpcclient $> queryuser 0x3e9

        User Name   :   cry0l1t3

# Brute Forcing User RIDs 

According to HTB we will often have to access `queryuser` but other commands that might provide ids for that command like `enumdomusers` will not always be on the system. 

Im not sure how many RIDs there can be on a sytem but apparently we can just brute force them. Heres an example using bash.
```shell
becker63@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.14.128 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done

        User Name   :   sambauser
        user_rid :      0x1f5
        group_rid:      0x201
		
        User Name   :   mrb3n
        user_rid :      0x3e8
        group_rid:      0x201
		
        User Name   :   cry0l1t3
        user_rid :      0x3e9
        group_rid:      0x201
```
## Brute forcing withÂ [samrdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/samrdump.py)

There is also an impacket script we can use to dump data about a share. Heres what that looks like.
```shell
becker63@htb[/htb]$ samrdump.py 10.129.14.128
